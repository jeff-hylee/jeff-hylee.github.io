Hi there! Jeff is a quantitative developer who currently works at [d1g1t](https://d1g1t.com/). His interests include software development, machine learning, and "power-building".

What you have found here are his **sanitized** learning notes, because sometimes it's hard to remember details about the stuff we learn. You can also find his **messy** notes [here](https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-4db79e76c63e4ce88c35822cc576fc35).
