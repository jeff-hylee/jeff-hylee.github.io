This is the `helloworld` equivalent of every blog.

The basic idea for this space is for it to be similar to cliff notes but for topics that I find interesting. In reality, I mantain a **messy** set of notes in [notion.so](https://www.notion.so) - which can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-4db79e76c63e4ce88c35822cc576fc35); but I much prefer people to look at notes that were created with other people in mind (as they are, hopefully, better written)
